ðŸ¤– Pepper Storyteller
In this university projects, we built a website and an application for Pepper, a human-scale robot that interacts with people. On web, we developed a system where both guests and registered users can read posted stories on the website, while registered users have the option to write new ones which require admin approval. These stories can be accessed through Pepper, that uses hand gestures, images, and speech to narrate the selected story.

The project webpage is currently hosted and accessible at this link  [HERE ðŸ”—](https://pepper4storytelling.altervista.org/index.php)


ðŸ“± Arcade
In this university project we developed an application with Android Studio consisting of a collection of mini-games. Each team member created a game and contributed to the frontend and backend implementation of the app. The app includes an online database that stores game results and displays them on a scoreboard, as well as a local database that allows for offline data storage.
